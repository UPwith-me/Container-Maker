# Commercial License

## Overview

Container-Maker is dual-licensed:

1. **AGPL-3.0** (GNU Affero General Public License v3.0) - For open source use
2. **Commercial License** - For proprietary/commercial use

## When You Need a Commercial License

You need a commercial license if you want to:

- **Integrate Container-Maker into a proprietary product** without making your entire product open source under AGPL-3.0
- **Distribute a modified version** of Container-Maker as part of a commercial product
- **Offer Container-Maker as a hosted/SaaS service** without open-sourcing your backend

## What's Allowed Without a Commercial License

You **DO NOT** need a commercial license if you:

- Use Container-Maker **internally within your company** (not distributing to customers)
- Use Container-Maker for **personal projects**
- Contribute to the open-source version
- Use Container-Maker in compliance with AGPL-3.0 (i.e., keep your modifications open source)

## AGPL-3.0 Requirements

If using under AGPL-3.0, you must:

1. **Disclose your source code** when you distribute the software or run it as a network service
2. **License your modifications** under AGPL-3.0
3. **Provide installation instructions** and the complete corresponding source code
4. **Preserve copyright notices**

## Pricing

Commercial licenses are available on a case-by-case basis. Pricing depends on:

- Company size
- Use case (embedded, SaaS, redistribution)
- Support requirements
